## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
I would like to build a financial tracking app. This app will take al your expenses and chart your spending against your earning. 

## Notes
My favorite apps are WhatsApp, Spotify, and Maps
+ For WhatsApp, I like that you can use it to communicate with anyone and it lets you know when a message has been deleted
+ For Spotify, I like that you can share songs and the app can recommend songs for you
+ For maps, I like that the app can run in the background, have widgets and share your location.
